# Nodes and Dots

## Project Description
Nodes and Dots is a strategic game where players manage a network of nodes (cities, bases, etc.) connected by edges (roads, paths, etc.). 
Players must efficiently manage resources, ships, and structures to expand their network and optimize their economy.

### Key Features
- **Graph-Based Gameplay**: The game world is represented as a graph with nodes and edges.
- **Resource Management**: Nodes and structures consume and produce various resources.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Ships use pathfinding algorithms to travel between nodes.
- **Production and Construction**: Resources are used to build more ships and structures.

## The Game World
- **Graph**: Represents the entire game world, consisting of interconnected nodes and edges.
- **Node**: Points on the graph representing cities, bases, or resource points.
- **Edge**: Connections between nodes that ships travel on.
- **Structures**: Buildings on nodes that consume and produce resources.
- **Ships**: Vehicles that transport resources between nodes using pathfinding algorithms.
- **Resources**: Various commodities that nodes and structures produce and consume.
